## **Itchy Thoughts 💭**

**Moulded 💆:** Over the Christmas Holiday of 2019, I decided to pass time by building a VScode theme that I would love to use of-course. I had an inspiration from Twitter's Light's out mode. This also serves as a learning process for me as I have not built a VScode extension prior to this.

**Kicker 😞:**
*As this moment this theme has not been released yet, you can watch or star this repo to get updated once the initial release is out.*
