## **Itchy Thoughts ðŸ’­**

**Moulded ðŸ’†:** Over the Christmas Holiday of 2019, I decided to pass time by building a VScode theme that I would love to use of-course. I had an inspiration from Twitter's Light's out mode. This also serves as a learning process for me as I have not built a VScode extension prior to this.
